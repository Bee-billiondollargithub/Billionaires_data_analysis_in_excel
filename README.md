In this project, we'll go over a full data analysis in Excel. This will cover the 3 essential parts which are data cleaning, data analysis, and data visualization. 
The data cleaning part will include key features such as removing duplicates, creating backups, changing text formatting and much more. 
The data analysis will begin with descriptive statistics to find the average, min, max, and much more. Then, we'll use pivot tables to analyze our data further.
Finally, in data visualization, we'll use slicers and dynamic charts to visualize our data interactively.
